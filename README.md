ABSTRACT: 
Smart city is a mission to provide the needs of the citizen in a smarter way balancing the sustainable life and environment. Urban planners ideally deal in developing the entire eco system which is represented by the four pillars of comprehensive development (institutional, physical, social and economic infrastructure). Based on this mission, our team has developed a game on smart city which comprises the basic development steps and processes involved in the smart city mission. This report gives an idea about smart city and how is it related to sustainable development of a smart city. Urban planners can make it as a source for the proper planning and development of the smart city. Moreover, people especially students from various disciplines can get an idea about the developments involved in the smart city and compare the progress with real world development with this game. The report provides all the basic information of the game and mainly focus on the upgrades in the game to tackle the real-life situations in development of smart city.

1.	INTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW  
Smart city, whenever this word comes in mind, majority thinks that the latest technologies and modern infrastructures in the cities are called smart cities. But the real terminology is different. Smart city is a mission accomplished by government of India on 25th June, 2015 to provide decent quality life to the citizens and to drive economic growth. Application of Smart Solutions will enable cities to use technology, information and data to improve infrastructure and services. Comprehensive development in this way will improve quality of life, create employment and enhance income for all, especially the poor and the disadvantaged, leading to inclusive Cities. These solutions are only possible with sustainable development of the cities and applying smart solutions to tackle the existing problems in the cities. The core infrastructure elements in a smart city are:

1.	Adequate water supply
2.	Assured electricity supply
3.	Sanitation, including solid waste management
4.	Efficient urban mobility and public transport
5.	Affordable housing, especially for the poor
6.	Robust IT connectivity and digitalization
7.	Good governance, especially e-Governance and citizens participation
8.	Sustainable environment
9.	Safety and security of citizens, particularly women, children and the elderly
10.	Health and education

Current generation children and many citizens do not know much of these kinds of information and even they are not able to show interest regarding smart cities. Even the urban planners are trying for different solutions to make the smart city beneficial.
Current generation is mostly involved in playing games in mobiles and pc. To make them enthusiastic about the smart city mission, our team has decided to design a game on smart city named MAKE IT SMART – turn your city into a smart city. This game provides basic information regarding a smart city by introducing various challenges while creating smart city, provide possible smart solutions to these challenges in a limited 2d environment through a unity game. Considering all the above-mentioned core infrastructural elements, we have considered the basic elements as priorities like hospitals, police stations, slums, governance, it parks, Industry, usage of natural resources. The game involves in developing or upgrading the present problems using smart and simple solutions. We try to show each and every element in our game through some sprite's (images) collected, and to let the player know about developing a city, challenges faced while upgrading a feature or element. To implement the idea of designing a game like this, proper planning, designing and execution of work is required to promote this game. In the upcoming sections, all the details regarding the game and planning involved by our team to develop this game is mentioned. 
The main objective of the game is promoting some simple smart solutions to develop the city, to ensure all the citizens about the development criteria involved in development of a city and to showcase in what aspects a city can be converted into smart city.
 The aim of Make it smart is to create city management game that can provide a virtual platform to learn what exactly a SMART CITY is and explore its various aspects. furthermore, by ensuring this smart city aspects and their problems are implemented in this game, we plan to educate people about various problem-solving methods related to smart city. We also intend to focus on the point that smart cities are not just about good infrastructure but also about its citizens welfare in all domains.
The scope of introducing the idea of Make it smart is to promote this game to the current generation to learn something which is really useful related to development and to get the idea of working of smart city. Urban planners can make this game as a reference to cross check whether the planning of development of a particular criterion is correct or wrong and also use the simple smart solutions implemented in the game. This game helps in increasing the thinking abilities of the present generation children and learn more about project management and risks involved in it and developing skills in it.

2.METHODOLOGY    
As mentioned earlier, we wanted to create a resource for students and urban planners to learn some basic things and to have a broad idea about smart cities in an easier way. We believe that a game is only the better option to create impact on students because this is the platform where they show more interest. After deciding the platform to build a game, proper information regarding smart cities, better solutions to develop the cities, various problems existing in the cities were deeply discussed by our team. We decided to focus mainly on upgrading different types of buildings to stress on the importance of core infrastructure elements in a smart city. We found many major problems and included many smart and simple solutions for the mentioned basic elements of the smart city. All the major problems of the basic elements were gathered from the official government websites and the respective references for those sources of information is mentioned in the reference's section. 
After figuring out all the features to be involved in the game, we decided to showcase this game in a 2D environment. We decided to develop the game in unity software through GitHub collaboration. All the necessary parts for developing the game were designing of sprites, implementation, scripting, UI design, sounds controller and animation. The work has been divided into teams as already mentioned in the flow chart of implementation.
For the developing of the game, first we started on the tile mapping for the layout of the city. After completion of this task, sprites were designed according to the requirement like buildings, airport, bus stops, schools, slums, hospitals and many more. The designed sprites were mapped into the tile layout and the basic city layout was completed. To convert this city into a smart city, major upgrades has to be done to convert into the smart city. The upgrades that were thought to implement were designed by the UI team and simultaneously the UI team also worked on making the scoreboard, setting up the time and creating pause menu, main menu, result board etc. Then scripting was done to all the upgrades that were represented in the game. After the completion of this task, our team worked on the level controller. Simultaneously we worked on the sound effects and also animation to make the environment of the city more realistic. After the completion of all these tasks, the only remaining task was execution. Our team played the game and found out some issues and we reported the bugs to the respective division. The errors and the bugs found out were resolved. The major task that was left is to bring the game into web platform/windows platform. The appropriate choices were done after the completion of fixing bugs.
The game works like this:
The player will be given a city which is poor in development and will be given some money as treasury. The player has to observe the city properly and find out the areas where there are problems and try to resolve it and working on development of existing.  When the player clicks a building for the respective development, a panel pops up which shows the available upgrades for that building. The player has to choose the upgrades wisely by proper planning of further development. Using the money, the player can upgrade the building. As the player upgrades the building, his score increases depending on the type of the upgrade he chose. Likewise, the player has to upgrade as many upgrades as possible using the money and should try to increase his score. The player will be given a fixed time for observing and developing the city. Once the time is over the game will finish and the score obtained by the player gives him the knowledge of management. So, through the upgrades, the player will be able to learn quite a lot things about the various aspects of smart cities.

3.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
Make it smart is a very linear single player game that tries to highlight the different aspects of a smart city. The objective of the player is to upgrade the city as much as possible. Even though all upgrades are building towards the betterment of the city, the player only has a few minutes (in game time) to develop the city. This is the balance we have in the game, where the player cannot upgrade each and everything as he wishes. Therefore, the player has to choose carefully, the upgrades that he wants to commit and manage his time so as to get the highest score. The in-game money system is a constant stream of cashflow that can be increased with some upgrades (like increased tax collection depending on city level) which will be unlocked only after the city improves its standard. These situations are very similar to an actual scenario where all the decisions made are analyzed carefully, and planned carefully. We want the player to understand, the various difficulties and challenges associated with city management. We identified the score and money system along with the time constraint as the best way to represent this in our game. A few screenshots from the game are shown below:

The upgrades presented in the game are based on 7 buildings:
•	Hospital
•	Police HQ
•	Municipal corporation building
•	Slums
•	Industry buildings
•	Office buildings (IT buildings)
•	Grid
The upgrades are related to these particular buildings and their functionality in general. The upgrades include improving the infrastructure, switching clean energy, changing redundant practices to make room for new methodologies and revamping systems like public transport, sewerage etc. The upgrade description is given in detail within in the game. In the end we want the player to be able to understand critical problems that are to be addressed in real life and also figure out new problems and their solutions. We hope that this will be of educational value and successful in terms of passing new information. All the information displayed the game (the upgrade choices in short) are obtained from various government sources and research papers. The sources are attached with this report in references. 
As mentioned earlier, the player has to develop the city in the given time and evaluate his score. The more, the player plays the game, the more he can evaluate his understanding regarding development involved in smart city.
The premise of this game is very broad and hence attention to details have been ignored at times (due to constraints in experience, time and art assets). But the fact that a small button-click based game like this can explain a lot about a broad concept like smart city validates our claim that a game can indeed be used as a learning platform or, maybe even simulate the development of an entire city from scratch. As for the feasibility of this project, it is not so costly to develop a game even when using premium assets and a team of experts. Though the cost increases with the quality of the game it is safe to say that it is worth it! A video game as an informative platform is also viable compared to traditional methods like websites.
As for the future we need to look more into simulation genre games, that can fully capture real life situations and express them with extended functionalities and the ability of choice. This is in stark contrast to what we have done here. A basic game like ours offers a set of linear choices where a perfectly crafted simulation game would provide full access to real world synonymous choices that would definitely be an urban planner’s best resource and a tool for various student disciplines as well.

4. CONCLUSIONS 
MAKE IT SMART is a 2D button-click based game that is a prototype which shows how much, a game in the lower end of the spectrum can be used as an informative tool. Video Games have a huge potential, that can be exploited to be an informative hub that allows interactions within a game environment to address simple and complex topics. In context of smart cities video games can be used to represent its individual components like traffic management systems, sewage systems, water supply chain, Construction management, Metros and so much more - in finer details and with more concrete implementation. This definitely is the future for our project idea.
Make it smart focuses on the broad aspects of smart city and therefore not on the details. It tries to introduce poorly known ideas like circular economy, industry 4.0 etc. The game basically is a “get to know what” platform where we try to show all the things that need to taken care of while planning for a smart city. Furthermore, with this game we intend to propose the idea that simulation games which are more structured and organized as a better alternative or an extension to an urban planner’s resources, as it allows for experimentation in stress free environment. But to achieve this a game is just a start, we need better AI systems that can detect the viability of such simulated cities or even better, the modifications in an existing city layout (the actual city layout) to weigh the pros and cons of each design. This data analytics can help correct flaws in our city designs, be it in transportation, waste management or any other sector. The purpose of mentioning this point is, we eventually wanted to build towards such a game, but felt it to be out of scope for our experience. Nevertheless, this should be the ultimate aim when thinking of having a game as a medium of representing a problem domain.
We look forward to improve our experience in game-making so that we could maybe be a part of something better, a highly efficient tool that aids in city development by focusing on small but important domains with more details. As for now, Make it smart stands as a small game that covers a lot of the basics related to city planning and administration.
